"""Dynamically overloaded functions.

This is an implementation of (dynamically, or run-time) overloaded
functions; also known as generic functions or multi-methods.

The dispatch algorithm uses the types of all argument for dispatch,
similar to (compile-time) overloaded functions or methods in C++ and
Java.

Most of the complexity in the algorithm comes from the need to support
subclasses in call signatures.  For example, if an function is
registered for a signature (T1, T2), then a call with a signature (S1,
S2) is acceptable, assuming that S1 is a subclass of T1, S2 a subclass
of T2, and there are no other more specific matches (see below).

If there are multiple matches and one of those doesn't *dominate* all
others, the match is deemed ambiguous and an exception is raised.  A
subtlety here: if, after removing the dominated matches, there are
still multiple matches left, but they all map to the same function,
then the match is not deemed ambiguous and that function is used.
Read the method find_func() below for details.

Python 2.5 is required due to the use of predicates any() and all().
