About
-----
This package provides tools to (imperfectly) translate Java source
code to python source code.


Install
-------
Before you install the package, make sure you have Python_ 2.5 or
newer, and that you have PyAntlr_.

To install the package and the scripts into your system, then as the
super user, run:

    $ python setup.py install


Use
---
Run the script like so:

    $ j2py -i input_file.java

Or:

    $ j2py -i input_file.java -o output_file.py

The script will read from stdin when no input files are given:

    $ j2py < some_file.java

The script has configuration options that you can view:

    $ j2py -h

You can customize the code generation via configuration modules.  Read
more about them on the wiki_.
